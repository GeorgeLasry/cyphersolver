# Keresdi Bethlen cipher letters, 1645-1648 (DECODE R4936-R4940, R4942)

Status: in progress

22 Oct 2026, reading audit (George Lasry's test: can sentences be built and translated?): only **R4940's two
cipher spans read** ("votumiok", "niert dolog volna", 23 letters). **R4936, R4937 and R4942 are decoded, not read**:
the mechanical decode and the solver outputs are letter streams with garbled words, no sentences. About 1% of the
transcribed cipher letters read. (Superseded 23 Oct 2026: R4936, R4937 and R4942 read, see the b15 block below.)

**Split on 14 Oct 2026 (one-key rule, George Lasry).** This target first grouped the ten records R4933-R4942 by their
DECODE number range. It now keeps the Keresdi Bethlen letters in the alphabet family of R4936/R4940 (R4936, R4940, and
R4937, R4942, which give fragments under it), plus R4938 and R4939 of the same Keresdi_Bethlen_15 series, which are
not yet inspected and for which no shared key is claimed. Split off, each a different cipher with its own entry:
R4941, a different substitution (`targets/r4941/`), and the Kemény_XIX_1628 records R4933-R4935
(`targets/kemeny1628/`). Their metadata and R4941's extract and solver results moved with them; the images stay in
the main checkout's `transylvania1645/` folder for all three. The record table below is the original survey of all
ten.

## Sources

28 images downloaded from the ten DECODE records on 23 September 2026 using the existing authenticated session. Catalogue metadata saved alongside images. No document attachments listed. The catalogue dates are not confined to 1645. R4936 first page inspected: clear Hungarian introduction and long alphabetic cipher passages. No decipherment claimed.

## Prior work

User objective reports no published reading found on 22 September 2026. Independent verification remains pending.

The first R4936 annealing result preceded consultation of printed letters. Afterwards downloaded:

- Lukinich, *Keresdi Bethlen Ferencz levelezése*, first instalment (1907), https://real.mtak.hu/192384/1/MagyarTortenelmiTar_1907_55_4_08.pdf . Locally extracted to `Bethlen-correspondence-1907.txt`. Starts 1622, ends around 1647; no matching cipher reading established. Introduction points to a separate diplomatic study.

## Progress, 23 September 2026

All 28 image files validated as image/jpg downloads; `image-manifest.json` gives hashes, sizes and exact download URLs. No credentials saved here. The contact sheet is for navigation only; inspect originals for reading.

| Record | Catalogue year | Work so far |
|---|---|---|
| R4933 | 1658, but name says 1628 | Two photographed spreads; requires detailed inspection and resolution of catalogue date conflict. |
| R4934 | 1628 | Two images; mostly cipher-looking text; not transcribed. |
| R4935 | 1628 | Four images; largely clear text, inspect short cipher insertions. |
| R4936 | 1645 | Both pages provisionally transcribed. Quadgram attack recovered Hungarian quickly. Many q/g, c/p, i/n transcription confusions remain. |
| R4937 | 1646 | Long single page. Partial extraction and successful Hungarian substitution fragments; no complete reading. |
| R4938 | 1647 | Four images, mainly clear text with short cipher insertion(s); not yet transcribed. |
| R4939 | 1648 | Two substantial text pages and address; not yet transcribed. |
| R4940 | 1648 | All surviving cipher read: 23 letters in two spans. See `R4940-reading.md`; both images inspected. |
| R4941 | 1648 | Different substitution, extract from pages 1–2 still not solved; pages 3–4 must also be inspected. |
| R4942 | 1648 | Partial page 2 extract yields Hungarian fragments. All other cipher spans still to inspect/transcribe. |

`attack.py` uses existing `hu-modern`, default quadgrams, no spaces, seed 4936, 50 x 12,000 trials. There was no need to add a duplicate Hungarian model. `python transylvania1645/attack.py R4941-extract 5` selects quintgrams. Early result filenames lack the order suffix; current script includes it. The raw inputs are PROVISIONAL and must not be presented as archival transcriptions.

Important transcription correction: a working shared alphabet family has c=p, p=c, g=u, q=t. The initial R4936 statistical key wrongly used c=u, g=t, q=p because the hand transcription confused these glyphs. `shared-key-hypothesis.json` fixes the proposed family mapping, with v/w representing a in different hands. This is not a verified full key for every record. First R4936 words are recognizably `persvadealni kell ...` and `... succumbalna szandekaban`; R4937 begins with `czasar dipplomaia ...`. R4940 is a useful held-out short reading using the family.

`noisy_probe.py` applies penalized alternatives to likely confused glyphs in R4936 and outputs `R4936-correction-hypotheses.json`. These are explicit UNVERIFIED hypotheses, not edits to the source transcription. They reveal coherent topics including musketeers, dragoons, payment, the king, the republic, Munkács and Rakovica. Every adopted correction needs an image check. Plaintext word spaces in explanatory notes are editorial.

**23 Oct 2026, re-read (REREAD_BRIEF, batch b15).** R4936, R4937 and R4942 are now **read** (grade B) with the family
key unchanged: R4936 re-transcribed from the images (215 label changes, `R4936_corrections.tsv`), R4937 and R4942
transcribed in full for the first time. Each has `<doc>_reading.md`, `<doc>_en.md`, a letter alignment with the figures
(`<doc>_align.tsv`, `research/reading_audit/b15_align.py`) and `<doc>_reread_log.md`. R4942's DECODE image 3 is a clear
slip of its cipher block in Zsigmond Rákóczi's name (`R4942_slip.txt`). Content: R4936 = numbered points for the 1645
Warsaw mission (3,000 musketeers and 1,000 dragoons to be hired, money at Danzig, Bregy and Croissy); R4937 = 1646, the
Emperor's diploma and the Evangelicals, hiring 4,000 foot; R4942 = Zsigmond Rákóczi 1648, the intermediaries and his
brother's plenipotentiary power. Caveat: `docs/_check_reading.py` cannot score 17th-c. Hungarian (0.07 and 0.0 on printed
1645 letters from Szilágyi 1885); explicit-hole share (b17_score.py HOLES=1) 0.94, 0.90, 1.00.
fraction_read 0.59 (estimated; R4938 and R4939 untranscribed).

## Remaining gaps

- R4937, R4942 read 23 Oct 2026 (b15). R4936 decoded, not read (verify sweep 23 Oct 2026): 130 letters (6.7%) on look-alike alternates, mostly t on g-shaped figures, plus five [?words] and two unread runs (l. 9, l. 16) - blocker: illegible; the DECODE scan (1,704 px, no larger file) does not separate the hand's g and q at 3x, and no contemporary or printed text confirms the choices
- R4937 l. 3 run after 'megsegni' and the end of l. 13 - blocker: illegible; decode to letter strings that are not words, checked at 2.2x
- R4938 (1647): three cipher spans (54 letters) decoded with the family key 23 Oct 2026; one word ('ailunkker') unread - blocker: too-short (occurs once). The clear letter around the spans is not transcribed (clear text, not a cipher gap).
- R4939 (1648): read 23 Oct 2026 (r2h); lines 03-09 keep about 12 unread words - blocker: illegible (figures decode to non-words with every look-alike pair tried, 3x crops of the 1,704-px scan; no printed text).
Of the records kept here: R4937, R4939, R4940, R4942 read; R4936 decoded, not read (illegible look-alikes); R4938's spans decoded, one word too short. No gap is left not-attempted (23 Oct 2026). R4939 is a different cipher (own key and hand): under the one-key rule it should become its own target before any write-up.

## Escalation
- [x] siblings: R4936, R4937, R4940, R4942 read with one family key (23 Oct 2026)
- [x] clear-pages: R4942 image 3 is a clear slip of its cipher block; no clear copies for R4936/R4937 on the records
- [x] known-keys: the family key (shared-key-hypothesis.json) applied unchanged
- [x] print: Lukinich 1908 (both instalments), Szilágyi 1885 (Linz), Erdély és az északkeleti háború I grepped; no edition
- [x] key-rebuild: not needed; the transcription was redone instead
- [x] retry: R4936 re-transcribed and read; R4937, R4942 transcribed in full and read (23 Oct 2026); R4938 spans decoded and R4939 broken and read (23 Oct 2026, r2h); R4939 checked by an independent second reader on 6 random lines (letters 93.9%, words not carried 8.3%; 23 Oct 2026, sr)

## Next work (earlier list)

1. Resolve transcription of R4936 q/g, c/e/p, i/n and other ambiguous forms against full-resolution crops; the substitution is substantially recoverable. Do not treat noisy language-model proposals as confirmed readings.
2. Transcribe the remaining R4937 and R4942 ciphertext; test shared family mapping, correcting the input rather than forcing bad mappings.
3. Inspect ALL original folios of R4933–35, R4938–39 and R4941. Short cipher spans may be solvable with sibling alphabets; R4941 needs separate attack and better transcription (long-s/f and g/q are suspects).
4. Follow the printed diplomatic-collection leads and compare dates/openings. Keep discovery chronology for contamination assessment. Consider period Hungarian corpus only if modern scoring remains insufficient after fixing the transcription.
5. Record every step in profile.json. It currently passes `docs/_check_profile.py` with unknowns explicitly retained.
6. Do not invoke writeup yet. User requires partial readings pushed toward completion first. Once the research is exhausted, use `.claude/skills/writeup/SKILL.md`, update DECODE queue and all required publication surfaces, and run its checker. Shared checkout has extensive unrelated modifications; stage explicit paths only if committing, and isolate any broad site rebuild as necessary.

## 23 Oct 2026 — verify sweep (reading audit v2): R4936 back to decoded, not read
- `R4936_align.tsv` (b15) puts 130 of the reading's 1,932 letters on the other member of a look-alike pair of the hand:
  g=t 114, q=u 6, c=y 4, g=g 3, h, a, n 1 each; 99 of 338 words carry one. That is 6.7%, above the brief's ~3% limit,
  and no contemporary or printed text confirms them (the pencil gloss under line 1 is a later reader's start).
- Checked on IMG_R4936_I28640_P1 (main checkout `transylvania1645/`) at 3x, lines 1-2 and 4-5: the g- and q-shaped
  figures ("rdkgng" holtig, "byucayhg" fegyvert, "lyzyinxyuyq" kemeniseget) do not separate at the scan's 1,704-px
  width, so the t/u choice is made by sense. DECODE has no larger file.
- Scores of the reading body: explicit holes 0.941 (32/34) as published; **0.147 (5/34)** with the look-alike words
  counted as holes (`research/reading_audit/v2_lookalike_holes.py`, `v2_score.py`); 0.029 plain (modern hu list).
- Result: R4936 `decoded, not read`, reading kept as a partial reading; fraction_read 0.59 -> 0.22 (estimated:
  R4937 869 + R4942 252 + R4940 23 of about 5,250 letters). A sharper image of Keresdi_Bethlen_14 (archive access)
  would settle g/q and could restore it.

## 23 Oct 2026 — r2h: R4938 and R4939 worked (`R4939_reread_log.md`)
- **R4939 read** (grade B). Every image opened (P1-P2 cipher, P3 clear address "Magnificis Francisco Betthlen de Keresd
  ... ac Andreae Klobusiczki ... ad moderna comitia Reipub. Poloniae legatis"); no DECODE documents or comments; the
  Erdély és az északkeleti háború I edition prints the envoys' October 1648 reports, not this letter. The family key
  gives nothing: R4939 is **a different simple substitution in a different hand**. Transcribed (`R4939-transcription.txt`,
  1,631 letters) and broken ciphertext-only by annealing (`research/reading_audit/r2h_r4939_anneal.py`, hu-modern;
  key `R4939_key.md`); 50 look-alike labels corrected on 3x crops (`R4939_corrections.tsv`). Reading `R4939_reading.md`,
  English `R4939_en.md`: the brothers write that their father György I Rákóczi is dying ("az doctor itileti szerent is
  eletehez ... semmi ... ninc"), that he did not want the Polish crown for himself, that seeking the principality for
  Zsigmond now would endanger the country "foe nekul", and bind Bethlen and Klobusiczky to promote "oeczem uram
  promotioiat" (Zsigmond's Polish candidacy), money to be spent on it. Explicit holes 0.75 (18/24); look-alike letters
  16/1,449 = 1.1%. Lines 03-09 keep unread groups (illegible).
- **R4938**: a clear letter of 24 Apr 1647 with three cipher spans on P2 (54 letters) in the family hand, decoded with the
  family key unchanged: "az Rakoczi Sigmon", "az nekunk [...] volna", "mi [?nevunkre] forogion"; a later pencil gloss
  agrees. Fragments, not counted as a reading; one word too short to settle.
- **R4936's g/q**: not settled. R4938's spans contain no t, so they cannot test the g/q choice; R4939's hand separates g
  and q on scans of the same width, so the limit is R4936's hand. Blocker unchanged (illegible).
- fraction_read 0.22 -> 0.58 (measured letters: R4937 + R4942 + R4940 + R4939 of all six transcriptions).

## 23 Oct 2026 — independent second reader on R4939 (sr, `R4939_sr_blind.tsv`)
- Sample: 6 cipher lines drawn with `random.seed(4939)` from lines 13-46 (lines 01-12 excluded: their first-pass labels
  had been seen before the draw): **16, 17, 24, 29, 32, 45**. Transcribed blind on 2-3x crops of the DECODE scans
  (P1/P2, 1704x2272, scratchpad only), decoded with `R4939_key.md`, then compared.
- **Letters: 200 of 213 agree (93.9%)**; 5 of the 13 differences are the q/g pair, the rest a/e, c/o, ÿ/g and one
  letter the first reader dropped. **Words: 8 of 36 (22%) not carried by the blind decode; 3 (8.3%) after re-cropping**:
  "bizoeta-" (l. 24; sr sees a y-descender, and neither reading gives a word: "bizontalan" would want q), "azekatru-"
  (l. 32; sr sees ÿ, "azokat-"), "kegylme" (l. 45; the scan has x g e o g h a g, "kegyelme").
- **Key**: one cipher letter one plain letter, 23 distinct values, and ten reciprocal pairs (a-m, b-i, c-p, d-u, e-g,
  f-v, h-l, o-y, r-z, s-t): a paired alphabet, which confirms the annealer's key on its structure. The blind decode reads
  as Hungarian of 1648 by sense ("ra vetni nem akariuc, az porta alapattia miben legyen tudhattia kegyelmetek, io
  securitas"; "az hol kivantatik, oeczem uram").
- Decision: under 1 in 10: **stays read, grade B**. The three words would be better given as [?bizon]talan, azokatru-,
  kegyelme at the next pass (reading not changed here).
