# Maximilian I's envoys in cipher, 1510-1512 (Unsolved Catalogue 495)

Status: in progress

HHStA Wien, RK Maximiliana: 24 reports catalogued as "Teilweise chiffriert" / "Chiffriert", plus three de Burgo
siblings noted as glossed (25-2-25, 25-2-27, 25-1-36). The AIS IDs, dates, places and extents are in `items.json`;
images from the AIS viewer (`fetch_ais.py`, git-ignored `img/`). Catalogue row in
`research/central_archives/candidates.json` (Oct 2026 HHStA sweep).

## What the documents are

| writer | items | place, date | system |
|---|---|---|---|
| Andrea de Burgo | 22-2-55, 22-3-5, 22-3-18, 23-5-17, 26-5-31, 27-1-5 (+ 25-1-36, 25-2-25, 25-2-27) | Blois, Grenoble, Valencia [Valence], Milan; Jun 1510-Apr 1512 | letter signs with word signs, vowels often dropped |
| Paulus de Laude (to de Burgo / Maximilian) | 26-3-50, 26-4-6, 26-4-9, 26-4-10, 26-4-15, 26-4-24, 26-4-25 | Blois, Jan-Feb 1512 | de Burgo's cipher |
| Veit von Fürst | 22-2-51, 22-2-56, 22-3-8, 22-3-42, 23-2-62, 23-3-6, 23-5-25 | Rome, Bologna; Jun 1510-Feb 1511 | single words in glyph letters inside clear Latin, plus sign-names |
| Mercurino Gattinara | 23-5-4, 23-5-47 | Seville, Feb 1511 | digit/symbol letters with dot separators, name signs |
| Giovanni Colla | 26-5-10 | Rome, 9 Mar 1512 | own letter-sign alphabet, fully ciphered |
| N.N. | 26-5-7 | Modena, 8 Mar 1512 | rounded signs plus number codes (370, 398) |

The catalogue row's date range "Jun 1510 - Mar 1516" is wrong: the items run 25 Jun 1510 to 2 Apr 1512.

## Main finding: read at the time

Every page was surveyed (`survey_batch1.md`, `survey_batch2.md`). Of about 2,100 cipher lines, nearly all carry a
contemporary decipherment written between the lines (word by word for Fürst and Gattinara, a running Latin line for
de Burgo, de Laude and Colla). There are no separate decipherment leaves. The catalogue premise ("no decipherment
noted"; only 25-2-25/25-2-27/25-1-36 glossed) is wrong: AIS simply does not record the glosses on the other items.
The two items described as fully ciphered (26-4-24, 26-5-10) are fully glossed too.

So the bulk of catalogue 495 is an existing decipherment. The open work is the residue the glossator skipped:

| piece | size | state |
|---|---|---|
| 26-4-9 img 04 (fol. 14), de Laude 5 Feb 1512, closing "Δ." paragraph | 195 signs, 6 lines | no gloss; in a water stain; read 17% firm (26% with uncertain words), fifth pass |
| 26-4-10 img 07 l. 29 | 16 signs | the gloss of l. 28 runs on into it: "sunt conformia suprascriptis" (read at the time) |
| 23-5-47 img 04 postscript ll. 4-5, Gattinara | 39 signs | l. 4 6/19 (ends "maiore [?]"), l. 5 1/20 (Maiestas) |
| 23-5-4 img 07 l. 17, three groups after "sit matrimonium" | 3 groups | "sit matrimonium principis Caroli [q̃ ?] Maiestat[-?]" (2/3) |
| Fürst's unglossed groups (22-2-51, 22-2-56, 22-3-8, 22-3-42, 23-3-6, 23-2-62) | 59 groups | 40 read firmly (18 are split-word halves of a glossed word, 17 had a gloss the survey missed), 13 in part, 6 open (`reading_veit.md`) |
| glosses lost to stains/holes (26-4-9, 26-4-10, 26-4-24, 26-4-25) | a few lines | not tried |

## Keys

- **De Burgo / de Laude** (`key_delaude.md`, `key_deburgo.md` in progress): one sign per letter with 2-3
  homophones for common letters, many dropped vowels (consonant skeletons), word signs `ro` = et,
  `g t 4 a ŧ o` = quod, `93` = Cesar / Maiestas Vestra, ⊞ = pro, `cc` (underlined) = Andreas de Burgo. De Laude
  uses de Burgo's cipher: every value checked agrees. Control on two held-out glossed lines: 31/37 letters (84%).
- **Fürst** (`key_veit.md`): substitution with glyphs, every letter that occurs has a value (all but h, k, y, z), homophones
  for u/v, s, q; words split across line ends with the gloss over one piece. Control: armata, presens, Nam, vendicare
  decipher letter for letter. 22-2-51 (25 Jun 1510) and 23-2-62 (Dec 1510) use other alphabets, only partly rebuilt.
- **Gattinara**: in progress.

## Prior art

Not printed that we found (web search 27 Oct 2026). Leads not yet checked: Andreas Zajic and Herbert Krammer
(Vienna) gave a talk on ciphers in Maximilian I's circle at the Wuppertal Geheimschriftenzoom, 24 Oct 2025; the
Regesta Imperii XIV (Wiesflecker) calendars Maximilian's correspondence and may summarise these reports from the
glosses; Penn Libraries (colenda 81431-p35718d9c) holds 1512 letters incl. 13 from de Burgo to Alberto Pio, "a few in code".

## Remaining gaps

- 26-4-9 img 04 "Δ." paragraph (195 signs, 17% firm) - blocker: open-codes; the five-sign group `ꝸ ꝑo f -u- ʒ` that opens D4 and D5 looks like a name/code word, and about 24 tokens (`ꝑo`, `-u-`, `⊐`, `ł`, `ψ`, `—2`, `bc`) have no glossed value yet. Still workable: unsearched glossed lines (25-2-27 ll. 5-12, 15; 22-3-18 img 08 ll. 19-21 and img 15; 25-2-25 img 08; 22-2-55 img 08; 22-3-5 img 04; the de Laude letters 26-4-10, 26-4-15, 26-4-24) may gloss them.
- 26-4-9 img 04 D0 and right half of D1 - blocker: illegible; water stain, crossed forms and hooks not separable on the AIS scan (needs a raking-light/UV image of fol. 14).
- 23-5-47 img 04 postscript ll. 4-5 (Gattinara) - blocker: open-codes; 11 signs with no glossed instance in the rows aligned so far; rows 23-5-4_07 y850-1000, _11 y1320-1840, _12 y1445-1550 and the 23-5-47 main text not yet aligned.
- 23-5-4 img 07 l. 17 `q̃` - blocker: open-codes; clear abbreviation or the Maiestas case group, unsettled.
- Fürst's 6 open groups (22-3-8 img 02 l. 18 `h/ d n ɏ`; 22-3-42 img 01 l. 20 cursive tail; 22-2-51 img 02 l. 18 `ɱ V`; 23-2-62 img 10 margin `θ - ꞇ 8`; 23-3-6 img 09 l. 21 `ꟿtra`; 23-3-6 img 02 `ʒ23 6`) - blocker: too-short; one to four signs each with no second occurrence, two of them in alphabets (25 Jun 1510, Dec 1510) not rebuilt; each sits beside a glossed clause. 13 further groups read in part (`reading_veit.md`).
- Glosses lost to stains/holes (26-4-9 imgs 01-02 lowest lines, 26-4-10 img 02 bottom 2 lines, 26-4-24 img 02 l. 1 right half and img 03 l. 1, 26-4-25 imgs 04, 06) - blocker: not-attempted; the cipher survives under most of them and can be read with the keys.

## Escalation

- [x] siblings: all 27 items in the series surveyed page by page (`survey_batch1.md`, `survey_batch2.md`); not on DECODE, so no DECODE siblings; de Laude shown to use de Burgo's cipher.
- [x] clear-pages: no separate decipherment leaves or clear copies in any item; the interlinear glosses are the decipherment and are the key source; 26-4-10 l. 29 turned out glossed via the run-on gloss of l. 28.
- [ ] known-keys: none in DECODE or print found; still to try: ask Andreas Zajic / Herbert Krammer (Vienna), who work on ciphers in Maximilian I's circle; Penn colenda 81431-p35718d9c (de Burgo to Alberto Pio, 1512, some in code).
- [ ] print: web searches (27 Oct) found no edition of these reports or their cipher; Regesta Imperii XIV printed volumes stop before 1510 and the online database was not searched; Tomokiyo has no Maximilian 1510 page found.
- [x] key-rebuild: de Burgo/de Laude table 43 rows (control 15/17 letters, 88%), Gattinara 31 signs (control 8/9 then 5/8), Fürst 15 signs; Latin LM used to rank consonant skeletons only.
- [ ] retry: unread groups retried after each pass (five passes on the Δ. paragraph); a retry after the remaining glossed lines are aligned is still to do.
