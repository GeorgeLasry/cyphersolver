# Francis Dana to Robert R. Livingston, St Petersburg, 6 Apr 1783 (O.S.), No. 23: the eight cipher lines

Status: in progress. Next step: check Dana's own table of October 1782 (PCC 89 vol. II p. 656, found by Brice Dudout, below) against the break and the four open groups; then try the key on the other despatches of PCC item 89 vol. 2 (the retry step).
Contributed by WAINUT (27 Oct 2026). Key recovered from the ciphertext alone; the text is read in part
(four code groups have no value). The site page and the ledger rows are left to the maintainer.

Catalogue 485. Contributed by WAINUT (https://github.com/WAINUTAI). The work was done with AI language-model agents.
Every number was read twice from the NARA scan, the second time independently, and the decryption was checked
against the image.

## 1. The document

- **Source.** NARA RG 360, Papers of the Continental Congress, item 89 vol. 2 (microfilm M247), catalogue
  [naId 502963402](https://catalog.archives.gov/id/502963402), "Letters from Ralph Izard, Henry Laurens, John Jay and
  Francis W. Dana 1777-84: Volume 2". The letter runs from MS p. 727 (digital object 312, heading
  "St Petersbourg April 6th 1783. O.S.", docket "(Tript. No. 23)") to p. 730 (object 315,
  [scan](https://catalog.archives.gov/medialz/partners/dc-metro/rg-360/M247/pcc_404461_0001/407507.jp2)), where the
  cipher stands.
- **Which copy.** The docket says this is the **triplicate** of No. 23. The original and the duplicate were not looked
  for.
- **Date.** 6 April 1783 Old Style is 17 April 1783 New Style. Wharton, *Revolutionary Diplomatic Correspondence*
  VI (1889), pp. 381-383, prints the same letter as "No. 23. St. Petersburgh, April 17, 1783". The catalogue entry
  gives 6 Apr 1783; both dates are right.
- **Context.** Dana had told the vice-chancellor of his mission on 7 March and had no answer. The clear text ends:
  "I have only to pray Congress would be pleased to suspend their judgment upon this matter ... All may yet end as we
  wish; it may end otherwise." Then come eight lines of numbers. Wharton prints "(Here follow eight lines of cipher.)".
- **The cipher is Dana's own.** P.S. in clear: "I make use of the Cypher I sent you by Mr. Adams's Son, having laid
  yours aside for the reason there mentioned." On 23 Sept 1782 (Wharton V, pp. 752-754) Dana had written that
  Livingston's cipher was "intolerably tedious and so liable to errors" and that he would "prepare another scheme"
  and send it to Holland by Mr. Adams' son, John Quincy Adams, then his secretary.
- **A difference from Wharton.** The P.S. on the scan reads "Your printed one has come to hand with your letter".
  Wharton prints "has not come to hand". No "not" is visible on the scan.

## 2. The system and the key

Periodic numerical table of the type James Lovell used. The alphabet has 27 signs, a..z and &. A letter p under key
letter K is written (p - K) mod 27 + 1, so the key letter itself is 1. The key word is **WIN**, used letter by letter
in a cycle of three. The full table is in `key.txt`. Numbers above 27 (29, 31, 137, 168) are code groups. Their
meanings are not known: the code list was not found.

How it was found: the numbers run 1-27 apart from four groups, which suggests a 27-sign table. An index-of-coincidence
test over periods (in the solver's working scripts, not included) pointed to alphabet size 27 and period 3, but the
signal is weak (period-3 IC 1.30 x 27, against 1.12-1.23 for other periods). What finds the key is the bigram ranking
of all period-3 keys (section 5), not the IC. The key letters then followed from the best shifts. `decrypt.py` reproduces the decryption from `transcription.txt`.

## 3. Transcription and interventions

`transcription.txt` gives 212 tokens (measured): 204 fully visible letter numbers, 4 code groups, and 4 numbers cut by
the edge of the microfilm frame (lines 1, 3, 4 and 6) with only their first digit visible.
Line 5 ends with a third "1" stroke at the edge. The ink blot in line 3 is not a number.

The decryption needs these interventions. All are written into the working text in `decrypt.py`, which checks that,
with the annotations removed, it gives back the transcription.

- **Three slips by Dana**, each in a W position: line 1 "23" and line 2 "12" (in "any") were enciphered with N; line 6
  "24" (in "influence") with I. With W they would give r, g and s.
- **One skipped key position** in line 5, after "irresistab". Without the skip the next letters are g/w; with it, "le".
- **Four cut numbers completed**, each matching its visible first digit: 1| = 11 (s), 1| = 15 (a), 2| = 27 (m),
  2| = 26 (l).
- **Three letters supplied** at line ends where nothing is visible: o (20) at the end of line 2, f (11) at the end of
  line 5 (a partial stroke is visible there), n (1) at the end of line 7. The key phase of the next line requires
  exactly one position in each case. Line 2 shows no cut, so there Dana may simply have left the letter out.
- **Code groups and the key.** After each of 31, 137 and 168 the next letter is under **N** (on the raw numbers:
  "liketh...", "adopti...", "herehe..."; W and I give nonsense). In `decrypt.py` terms, after 137 the key continues
  and after 31 and 168 it moves two places on, but the simpler description is that every code group in the body
  resets the key to N. Dana's earlier key sheet "No. 1" (section 6) carries exactly such a rule on its back:
  "N.B. When you come to an arbitrary character begin [the] key word again." After the opening 29 the text starts
  under W, which the reset does not explain. It changes no letter. Because of this, the opening "[29]n an [31]" is
  not confirmed: the letters n, a, n decode directly, but how they join the groups is open.

Of 211 letter positions, 201 decode directly and 10 need one of the interventions above.

## 4. The reading

Line by line in `decryption.txt` (output of `python decrypt.py`), as sentences in `reading.md`:

> [29]n an [31] like this, which is not guided by any settled principles or system, you can be certain of no
> measure. What the [137] adopt in this hour may be opposed by an irresistible influence in the next. In short,
> properly speaking, there is no [168] here. Hence my present difficulty.

The plaintext is English. Dana writes "irresistable"; the reading normalises the spelling. Context suggests readings
for the code groups ("In an [empire? court?] like this", "what the [ministers? court?] adopt", "there is no
[system? ministry?] here"), but none is proposed as a value.

What the passage says: Dana explains why he cannot predict the answer to his mission. At the Russian court nothing is
settled by principle, and what one party adopts may be overturned by another influence the next hour. The letter
dates from the weeks when Catherine II gave no answer to Dana and had just accepted the invitation to mediate the
definitive peace.

## 5. Controls (`python decrypt.py --controls`)

Scores are mean letter-bigram log-probabilities, with bigrams counted from the repository's English word list
(`lang/lexicons/en.json.gz`).

- The decryption with the interventions scores **-2.739**.
- 200 random wrong period-3 keys with the same alignment: best -4.431, mean -6.102.
- All 19,683 period-3 keys on the raw stream (the 204 fully visible letter numbers, no corrections, key running
  straight on): WIN ranks second (-4.680) and its rotation NWI tenth. The best key, WIP (-4.652), differs only in the
  third letter: the uncorrected phase breaks at the code groups shift the third position. The median key scores
  -6.167.
- 200 shuffles of the raw stream under WIN: best -4.874, mean -5.513.

An independent check of 27 Oct 2026 (separate re-reading of the scan, separate decryption script, Federalist bigram
model) gave the same plaintext and the same controls pattern: blind search over all period-3 keys on the raw stream
put the rotations of WIN at ranks 0 and 8.

## 6. Prior work

- Wharton VI (1889), pp. 381-383, prints No. 23 with "(Here follow eight lines of cipher.)" and no decipherment.
- The Madison Papers (note to JM to TJ, 11 Aug 1783, Founders Online Madison/01-07-02-0151, quoted in the catalogue)
  say only 8 lines were encoded and that the passage is not decoded in Wharton.
- Wharton VI, p. 464, has the footnote "The key to Mr. Dana's cipher is missing." It belongs to a **different**
  letter, Dana to John Adams, St Petersburg, 1 June 1783, and to the figures 121 and 134.571 in it ("Most probably the
  figures stand for Dr. Franklin and the French ministry"). It says nothing about No. 23.
- Two web searches for phrases of the plaintext found no printed decipherment. The Papers of John Adams (vol. 13)
  describe a separate Livingston nomenclator endorsed "Mr Dana's Papers"; Dana's P.S. says he did not use
  Livingston's cipher here.
- **Dana's key sheet in PCC item 59 vol. 1** (pp. 137-138, naId 475671573 images 107-108, Fold3 172700-172701; listed
  in `targets/pcc1780`), checked after the break on a reviewer's lead. It is headed "No. 1": a 25-sign table (a..z
  without j and v, plus &) in three columns that are not the W, I, N alphabets, and a word list numbered 26-52
  (Washington 40, Congress 26, America 27, England 29, France 30, Holland 31, ... Russia 51, Court 52). It is not the
  27-sign WIN scheme of No. 23: 137 and 168 are not on it, and England / Holland do not fit "[29]n an [31] like
  this". So the WIN key was not available from it, and the method stays ciphertext-only. The sheet is probably the
  cipher Dana took to Russia in 1781; the 1782 scheme sent by J. Q. Adams was not found. The verso has the restart
  rule quoted in section 3.
- The Papers of John Adams vol. 13 (Dana to John Adams, 4 Oct 1782, and the editors' notes) describe Dana's cipher;
  not checked.
- Not checked: the original and duplicate of No. 23 elsewhere in the PCC (one may carry a decipherment), the Hawkins
  transcripts (naId 2316037), Giunta's *The Emerging Nation*, and the Dana Papers at the Massachusetts Historical
  Society. **No earlier solution was found, but the search was not exhaustive.**

## Dana's own table and Brice Dudout's parallel reading (27 Oct 2026)

Brice Dudout (Europe chiffrée, `https://bdudout.github.io/europe-chiffree/en/documents.html#dana-1783`) read the same
eight lines on the same day, independently. He first broke the three shifted alphabets blind (letter frequencies and
English 4-grams), as was done here, then found **Dana's table of October 1782 in the same volume, PCC 89 vol. II
p. 656** by leafing through it: three shifted alphabets of 27 signs (a-z and &) starting at n, w and i, used in turn; a
nomenclator of words and names numbered 30 to 305, three numbers per word; the keyword starts again after every
number above 27. Its three columns coincide with the shifts of his blind break, and it reproduces its own example
("When the Army of America go"). Dana's note on the sheet: he sends it "only because I have probable grounds to
suppose yours is in the hands of the Ministry here"; it went by John Quincy Adams. This is the 1782 code list that
section 6 looked for; the PCC 59 "No. 1" sheet is the earlier scheme.

Values for the four open groups, from his reading: **31 = Administration; 137 and 168 = Minister** (two of its three
numbers); **29 is Dana's slip for i** ("In an Administration like this"). So: "What the Minister adopt in this hour
may be opposed by an irresistable influence in the next. In short, properly speaking, there is no Minister here.
Hence my present difficulty." He counts 213 visible groups and 2 lost in the gutter, and four enciphering slips, each
the value of the letter in a neighbouring column; reading about 98%. On the sentences compared (lines 1-5), his
text and the reading here are the same wherever both give a value. Not yet checked here against p. 656 itself. Catalogue 485 was removed on
27 Oct 2026 as read.

## Remaining gaps

- Code groups 29, 31, 137 and 168 (4 of 215 tokens) - blocker: open-codes until checked; Brice Dudout reads them from Dana's 1782 table (PCC 89 vol. II p. 656) as i (a slip), Administration, Minister, Minister; the sheet has not yet been viewed here.
- The letters supplied at the ends of lines 2, 5 and 7 rest on the key phase only - blocker: needs-physical-access.
  The frame edge cuts the lines on the microfilm; the original sheet (or the original and duplicate of No. 23) would
  settle them.

## Escalation

- [x] siblings: the clear P.S. and Dana's letter of 23 Sept 1782 identify the cipher as his own scheme; other letters
  in it were not decrypted (next step)
- [x] clear-pages: the clear text of No. 23 (Wharton VI) frames the passage; it gives no crib for the code groups
- [x] known-keys: Livingston's cipher is ruled out by Dana's own P.S.; Dana's earlier "No. 1" sheet (PCC 59 vol. 1
  pp. 137-138) checked: a different, 25-sign scheme without 137 or 168; the key was recovered from the ciphertext
- [x] print: Wharton V-VI read; the "key missing" footnote traced to the 1 June 1783 letter to Adams
- [x] key-rebuild: the letter table is complete (WIN); the code groups have one occurrence each
- [ ] retry: Dana's other 1783 despatches in PCC item 89 vol. 2 may use the same scheme and repeat the code groups
